## Teamnovu's Fork

This is a fork of the [Statamic core](https://github.com/statamic/cms) with some additional features and bugfixes.
The goal is to keep the fork as close to the original as possible. This makes it easier to merge changes from the core to the fork.

To achieve this, changes should be made as an addon instead. If this is not possible, the changes should be documented in the [DIFF-TO-CORE.md](DIFF-TO-CORE.md) file.
Ideally, a PR to the core should be opened.

### Installation

To install the fork, add the following to your `composer.json` file:

```json
{
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "git",
            "url": "https://github.com/teamnovu/cms.git"
        }
    ]
}
```

Then run `composer update statamic/cms` to install the fork.
